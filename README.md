# CSC2002S-Assignment-3
This aim of this assignment is to demonstrate the ability of parallel algorithms to provide an increase in both speed and 
overall performance compared to the performance sequential algorithms for various tasks.

This project involves calculating and adding totals over a large grid of data objects and the main objective was to 
evaluate whether using a parallel solution would yield greater computational rates when compared to a sequential program, 
and if this diﬀerence remains constant across varying data set sizes and architectures.

The given problem requires the program to take the output of a weather simulation and perform various analysis to determine 
the resultant wind direction and diﬀerent types of clouds that may be produced. 
These types of clouds include: Cumulus (0), Striated Stratus (1) and Amorphous Stratus (2).

The Makefile will compile and run the CloudClassification.java program which takes in "inputFileName outputFileName" and 
performs the necessary calculations and classifications.
